# Changelog for Alchemy SDK for JavaScript

## Unreleased

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes

## 3.5.1

### Minor Changes

- Added many new networks

## 3.5.0

### Major Changes

- Added a new `PricesNamespace` with three new methods: `getTokenPriceByAddress()`, `getTokenPriceBySymbol()`, `getHistoricalPriceByAddress`, and `getHistoricalPriceBySymbol()`. Access these methods via `alchemy.prices`.

## 3.4.8

### Minor Changes

- Added networks for `FLOW`.

## 3.4.7

### Minor Changes

- Added networks for `ROOTSTOCK`.

## 3.4.6

### Minor Changes

- Fixed webhook network parsing in `getAllWebhooks` method for all supported networks.

## 3.4.5

### Minor Changes

- Fixed createWebhook's `skip_empty_messages` param.

## 3.4.4

### Minor Changes

- Added networks for `WORLDCHAIN`.

## 3.4.3

### Minor Changes

- Added networks for `SONEIUM` and `BERACHAIN`. Note that these are primarily for `CoreNamespace` methods. Not all namespaces will work with these networks.

## 3.4.2

### Minor Changes

- Addressed security vulnerabilities by adding overrides for `elliptic` and `ws` dependencies. Specifically:
  - Updated `elliptic` to version `6.5.7` (latest) to fix vulnerabilities related to EDDSA signature length checks and ECDSA BER-encoded signatures.
  - Updated `ws` to version `7.5.10` to mitigate a potential DoS vulnerability. The latest major version of `ws` is `8.x`, however, `7.5.10` is the most up-to-date version compatible with `ethers v5`, which depends on `7.x` versions of `ws`.

## 3.4.1

### Minor Changes

- Fixed a bug where the `openSeaMetadata?.safelistRequestStatus` was undefined in the `Nft` object that resulted in a `Cannot read properties of undefined` error (#416)

## 3.4.0

### Major Changes

- Added networks for `SHAPE`, `LINEA`, `FANTOM`, `ZETACHAIN`, `ARBNOVA`, `BLAST`, `MANTLE`, `SCROLL`, `GNOSIS`, `BNB`, `AVAX`, `CELO`, `METIS`, `OPBNB`. Note that these are primarily for `CoreNamespace` methods. Not all namespaces will work these networks.
- App IDs are now a required property when calling `NotifyNamespace.createWebhook()` with `WebhookType.GRAPHQL`. This is not a Typescript breaking change, but rather a run-time breaking change. Calling the endpoint without an App ID will now throw an error instead of returning a 503.

### Minor Changes

- Fixed a bug with `NotifyNamespace.createWebhook()` when using `WebhookType.GRAPHQL`. Also added the option use `skipEmptyMessages` when creating graphQL webhooks to skip empty blocks.
- Updated axios version to remove security warning (#443).

- Updated instantiation syntax: `initializeAlchemy(settings)` is now `new Alchemy(settings)`
- Added three namespaces under the Alchemy object: `core`, `nft`, and `ws`. All Ethers.js provider methods and Alchemy Enhanced APIs (other than NFT) are under `core`.
- Moved top-level methods under the Alchemy object. Instead of `getNftsByOwner(alchemy, 'vitalik.eth')`, now methods are called using `alchemy.nft.getNftsByOwner('vitalik.eth')`
- Ethers.js Alchemy Provider methods are now directly embedded under `alchemy.core`
- Ethers.js WebSocket Provider methods are now directly embedded under `alchemy.ws`
- The settings object is now a config module under `alchemy.config`.
- If necessary, the full Ethers.js Provider is now available under `alchemy.config.getProvider()` as a promise to reduce bundle size.
- If necessary, the full WebSocket Provider is now available under `alchemy.config.getWebSocketProvider()` as a promise to reduce bundle size.
- Dynamic imports for large methods (in particular, Ethers.js methods) are now supported. Initial package size for the Alchemy SDK is 20kB, and will only download Ethers.js packages when a relevant method is called.
- Methods including Collection in the NFT package have been renamed to `Contract`: for instance, `getNftsForCollection` is now `getNftsForContract`.
