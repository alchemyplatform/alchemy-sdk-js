# Interface: DebugCallTracer

Tracer used with debug methods in the [DebugNamespace](../classes/DebugNamespace.md).

This tracer tracks all call frames executed during a transaction, including
depth 0. The returned result [DebugCallTrace](DebugCallTrace.md) is a nested list of call
frames executed as part of the call.

Here are some things to note when using the call tracer:
- Calls to precompiles are also included in the result.
- In case a frame reverts, the field output will contain the raw return data.
- In case the top level frame reverts, its `revertReason` field will contain
  the parsed reason of revert as returned by the Solidity contract
